## Game Description

In **Space Blitz**, you take control of a spaceship in an intense battle against waves of enemy ships. Your mission is to survive and eliminate as many opponents as possible while navigating through a vast and hostile space environment.

Your ship moves freely across the screen, and you can aim and shoot with precision using your mouse. Along the way, you'll find **power-ups** to aid your survival: hearts that restore health and shields that provide temporary invulnerability. Are you ready to test your skills and become the ultimate space ace?

## Features

- **Intuitive Mouse Controls**: Aim and shoot using the mouse for precise targeting.
- **Free Movement**: Navigate freely across the screen to dodge enemy attacks.
- **Dynamic Enemies**: Face increasingly challenging waves of enemy ships.
- **Power-ups**: Collect hearts to regain lives and shields for temporary invulnerability.
- **Beautiful Graphics**: Enjoy a visually appealing space environment.
- **Engaging Soundtrack**: Immerse yourself in the action with an exciting soundtrack.
